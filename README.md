Give your AI Agent the compiler's brain, not a text searcher.

gopls-mcp delivers lightning-fast, language-level analysis directly to your LLM. 
Unlike standard retrieval tools that flood the context window with irrelevant text, this tool performs surgical code navigation.

By providing only the scientifically accurate definitions and references, it maximizes your model's attention span and keeps the reasoning chain pure. Zero noise, absolute structural accuracy, and instant response times.
